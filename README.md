The Airborne Vehicle Health Parameter Monitoring System is a Java-based software 
application developed using the GLG Toolkit. It aims to monitor and analyze critical health 
parameters of airborne vehicles, such as engine performance, fuel consumption, velocity, 
temperature, pressure and voltage, in real-time. The system utilizes Java's robustness and 
the GLG Toolkit's visualization capabilities to create visually appealing displays and 
interactive dashboards for easy interpretation of the monitored data. Various charts, graphs, 
gauges, and maps are used for data visualization, enabling easy analysis. Historical data 
analysis allows for trend identification and performance optimization. The system 
enhances safety by detecting issues early, facilitates efficient maintenance, and contributes 
to operational efficiency by optimizing performance. 
With its customizable and scalable nature, the Airborne Vehicle Health Parameter 
Monitoring System provides a valuable solution for effectively monitoring and managing 
critical health parameters in airborne vehicles
